        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>WHAT IS PRACTICE PERFECT?</h2>
            <p>Maree Garrett has spent the last 22 years building her accounting practice from a “one man band” in the spare bedroom of her then home at Berowra to a practice in Hornsby CBD employing 10 people and lodging 2,500 tax returns each year. Technology has been a big part of the growth of Maree’s practice and over the years she has learned many “tips and tricks” in building efficiencies into her practice.</p>
            <p>Maree has worked mostly with the MYOB suite of products for accountants using the features of the software to their best advantage. Over the years she has had extensive experience with MYOB including being featured in the annual MYOB Roadshow for accountants on two occasions. This involved MYOB sending a film crew to her practice to showcase the efficiency advances achieved through use of technology.</p>
            <p>Having decided to move on from providing accounting and taxation services, Maree is now available to assist other accountants in achieving those same efficiencies.</p>
            <p>If you feel that your practice is not up to scratch with the latest technology, or if you are new to running an accounting practice, through having purchased an existing practice or setting up afresh, Maree can help you run your practice more efficiently.</p>
